# csvDuplicateContentChecker
Read a *csv file, then check and remove duplicate content
-----
I was helping another headhunting team to run their email marketing campaign.
The demand was to check for the list of email address in a *.csv file to make sure the email address was unique and remove the duplicate one if any.

This simple script will help to:
- read the *csv file
- filter then remove duplicate content from *csv file

Please feel free to use or improve this script as your need
